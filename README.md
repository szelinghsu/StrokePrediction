## Motivation and objectives
Stroke is the No. 5 cause of death and a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. According to CDC, stroke kills nearly 150,000 of the 860,000 Americans who die of cardiovascular disease each year. Stroke causes brain tissue to die and in turn lead to brain damage, disability, and death. Every year, about 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke and about 25% of the cases are recurrent. People who had a stroke before have a higher risk of having a recurrent stroke.

There are many factors contribute to the risk of stroke. Some are beyond oneâ€™s control like gender and age. Others can be controlled like high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and smoking habits. The objectives of this project are to analyze 10 factors in relation to stroke and to predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke.
